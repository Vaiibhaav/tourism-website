            <p class="para">Hawa Mahal, Jaipur’s most iconic landmark, is no ordinary piece of architecture. It is a beguiling, 5-storied building dating back to the 18th century, which, with its lacy grillworks and honey-comb facade, renders city dwellers and travellers an extraordinary visual spectacle. From its intricate decors to the panoramas visible from here, Hawa Mahal is a popular landmark that demands a visit at least one in life. The alluring Hawa Mahal night view - when the moonlight shines on the city, is an experience in itself that leaves visitors awestruck. Keep your cameras ready as each angle proffered by the mahal deserves a snap!</p>
            <br>
            <p class="para">The history of Hawa Mahal, the palace of winds, is quite intriguing. It was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh for the court harem so that they could witness the royal processions and the street life. The exquisite pink and red sandstone ‘mahal’ stands out for its striking architecture, and the beautiful ‘jhaali’ works on its 953 windows.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="para">Known as Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh’s favourite resort, the palace was designed by an architect named Lal Chand Usta. The Hawa Mahal architecture is defined by its five-story tiered shape that rises to about 50 feet. The elevated facade resembles a honeycomb with small portholes, each with miniature windows, carved sandstone grills, and finials. The interior however consists of minimalistic decorative elements as compared to its gaudy exteriors.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="para">The Hawa Mahal architectural style is an incredible amalgamation of Hindu Rajput and Islamic Mughal-influenced designs. Its interiors are composed of large chambers with different coloured marbles, inlaid panels and glidings. Its entry is through a large imperial door that leads to a fountain-laden courtyard, enclosed by double-storied buildings. Every floor of Hawa Mahal has a temple.</p>

            <p class="para">The Hawa Mahal is a five-story pyramidal shaped palace in Jaipur, built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in 1799. It rises to about 50 feet (15 m) and has a unique façade consisting of 953 niches with intricately carved jharokhas. The palace was designed by architect Lal Chand Usta and constructed from red and pink colored sandstone, in keeping with the décor of other monuments in the city. The palace's front elevation as seen from the street is like a honeycomb with small portholes, each with miniature windows and carved sandstone grills, finials, and domes. The palace's inner face on the back side of the building consists of chambers built with pillars and corridors with minimal ornamentation and reach up to the top floor. The palace's interior is said to have rooms of different colored marbles, relieved by inlaid panels or gilding, while fountains adorn the center of the courtyard. The palace's design reflects a fusion of Hindu Rajput architecture and Islamic Mughal architecture, with Rajput styles seen in the form of domed canopies, fluted pillars, lotus and floral patterns, and Islamic styles evident in its stone inlay filigree work and arches. The palace's entry is through an imperial door which opens into a large courtyard, which has double-storeyed buildings on three sides, with the Hawa Mahal enclosing it on the east side. An archaeological museum is also housed in this courtyard. The palace was a favorite resort of Maharaja Jai Singh because of its elegance and built-in interior. The palace's cooling effect in the chambers, provided by the breeze passing through the small windows of the façade, was enhanced by the fountains provided at the center of each of the chambers. The top two floors of the Hawa Mahal can only be accessed through ramps and it is maintained by the archaeological department of the Government of Rajasthan. </p>
